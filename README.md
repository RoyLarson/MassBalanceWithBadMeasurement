# MassBalanceWithBadMeasurement

## System
Several inlets to a piping system with one outlet

Per mass balance rules M_out = sum(Inlets)
and 
Each Inlet_i = M_out - sum(Inlets_not_i)

There is measurement on each point but they are noisy and temporarily

How to combine the signals to get the most accurate measurement of each
